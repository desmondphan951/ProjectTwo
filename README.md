## Summary
---
Our project is to develop a system that assist the users to achieve a top-performing and diversified portfolio that allows them to invest in global markets and industries.

In this project, our group will investigate the performance of different ML algorithms in obtaining precise nowcasts of the current gross domestic product (GDP) growth, top industry performers in OECD countries within five years timeframe, and then evaluate the real-time performance of these algorithms to determine an optimal investment portfolio.  

After determining the market fundamentals, industry growth, and market conditions, we will adapt and integrate into the portfolio management by providing our users with an effective trade management system. Such an example is to develop and strategize optimal key entry and exit points in our trading strategies.
